Being a great software architect isn't about using the latest and greatest technologies.

It's about:

- building the simplest thing that could possibly work
- making decisions based on tradeoffs
- collaborating well with others
- solving business problems
- leaning on experience

Certainly learn all the latest technologies, techniques, and patterns you can.

It will make you better at your job.

Just realize that this knowledge alone won't make you a great software architect.

It's much more than that.
