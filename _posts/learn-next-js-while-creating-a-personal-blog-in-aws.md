We've all said it:

- I want to learn Next.js
- I want to try out AWS Amplify
- I want to setup a personal blog

How can I do it all?

Here's your chance.  Finally, a tutorial where you learn while actually building something useful.  Does it get any better than that?

By the end of this article, you'll have your own personal blog, built with Next.js, and hosted on AWS.  I'll even show you how to setup your own domain so you can share it with the world.  It's never been easier to start some self-promotion.

Need proof?  The article your reading was imported to Medium from jacoborshalick.me which was created using the steps shown here.  So no more excuses, let's get it built!

- Install Node.js
- Install Next.js
- Make sure you have Git installed

# Retrieve the blog example

Execute the following to retrieve the blog starter:

You don't want my face and name on your blog.  Let's fix that.

# Push your project to your Git repository

# Now let's deploy to AWS Amplify

# Setting up a domain
