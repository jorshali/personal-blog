Sometimes the most productive thing a developer can do is:

```
git checkout .
```

Why?

Maybe:

- You tried to refactor something and it just didn't work out.
- You really broke something and need to start over.
- You had an idea and it turned out to be a bad one.

You don't always have to salvage the work you've done.

The only value left may be what you learned.

And that's extremely valuable.

This is one of the great things about source control.

You are free to experiement and learn without consequence.

You always have a base to go back to if you just really muck things up.

So remember...

Throwing away that failed experiment may be the most productive thing you can do.

The real value comes from what you learned along the way.
