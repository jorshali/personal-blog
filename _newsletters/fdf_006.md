## If your releases are an all-hands-on-deck, weekend endeavor for your team, they don’t have to be. There’s a much better way.

If every software release is: 

– don’t even think about it during office hours 
– timing all the commands you have to run 
– white knuckling the whole way 
– all-hands-on-deck 

You’re doing it wrong. 

Releases should be:

– predictable 
– automated 
– revertable 
– boring 

Some releases may require more baby-sitting. Some may have to be done on off hours. But these should be the exception to the rule.

## So remember… 

Keep your life exciting, but make your release process boring.
