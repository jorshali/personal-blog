## It's the only way to make sure you're solving the *right* problem when working with a product owner or a member of the business.

Kids are great at getting to the root of anything they want to understand.

They're curious.

When they want to know more, they ask.

A recent conversation:

> __My son:__  Dad, why is everything stuck to the Earth?
> 
> __Me:__  Because of gravity.
> 
> __My son:__  But why does the earth have gravity?
>
> __Me:__  Well, the Earth is really big which means a lot of mass.  Mass creates the gravity.
> 
> __My son:__  Why does mass create gravity?
>
> __Me:__  Well, it has to do with massive objects and time bending (I’m waving my hands and he can hear in my voice I’m getting out of my comfort zone).
>
> __My son:__  *smirks* Do we need to ask ChatGPT?

We often ask how, but as a consultant I constantly find myself asking why.  The why is how you truly understand something.

It's often where you find the deficiencies and the real underlying problems when working with a business.  You can't assume that the way things are done today is the best way.

While the *how* is certainly important, don’t forget to ask *why*.  Keep asking until you make sure you understand.

If it still doesn't make sense, you may have found a problem that's worth solving.
