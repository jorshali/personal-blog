## It's the best way to find the real underlying problems when working with the business or a product owner.

Kids are great at getting to the root of anything they want to know.

They're curious.

When they want to know more, they ask why.

A recent conversation:

__My son:__  Dad why are we stuck to the Earth?

__Me:__  It's because of gravity.

__My son:__  Yes, but why does the earth have gravity.
Me:  Well, the Earth is really big which means a lot of mass.  Mass creates the gravity.

__My son:__  Why does mass create gravity?

__Me:__  Well, it has to do with massive objects bending time and the time well pulls other objects toward it (I’m waving my hands and you can hear in my voice I’m getting out of my comfort zone).

__My son:__  But why would time have anything to do with massive objects?

__Me:__  Ummm….   Let's try asking ChatGPT…

We often ask how, but as a consultant I constantly find myself asking why.  The why is how you truly understand something.

It's often where you find the deficiencies and the real underlying problems.  You can't assume that the way things are done today is the best way.

While the *how* is certainly important, don’t forget to ask *why*.  Keep asking until you make sure you understand.

If it still doesn't make sense, you may have found a problem that's worth solving.
