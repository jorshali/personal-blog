## Don’t hijack requirements meetings with “tech speak.”

Developers love to talk tables, schemas, services, queues, JSON, APIs...

But non-technical people hear a foreign language.

Their eyes glaze over.

They lose interest.

Conversations are “over their head.”

Communication breaks down.

They may even lose interest in meeting with the development team altogether (insert analyst here).

Prematurely jumping into technical details is a sure way to solve the wrong problem.

Your developers need to speak the language of the business to really understand the problem.

How?

- Use the terminology of the business in conversation and requirements.
- Model the system around real world business concepts.
- Redirect tech speak in conversations with stakeholders.

Solving the right problem requires great communication.

Speaking the language of the business helps.

Is your team struggling to speak the language of the business?

Are they more focused on technical details than solving business problems?
