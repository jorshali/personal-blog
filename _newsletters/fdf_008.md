## We need to do more with less.

It's a common refrain among IT departments right now.

Budgets are tight.  We can't afford to add to our head count.

But, are you stretching your development team too thin?

Can you afford to lose the developers you have?

- Constant production fire-fighting
- Frequent status requests
- Unrealistic deadlines
- Working weekends

This is how you set your team up for burn out.

If this is your mode of operation, they will start looking for greener pastures.

It’s only a matter of time.
