## This week our focus is helping you stand apart from the crowd by creating an online presence.

Easier said than done? What if I told you it will take less than half an hour of your time.

Developer's who have an online presence are always going to have a leg up on the competition.

I put together an easy to follow 3 step tutorial series will help you do just that. You'll also build some technical skills with some in-demand technologies along the way.

By the end you will have:

- A hosted portfolio site with links to your profile and articles
- A GitHub repository under your name you can reference
- A head start learning in-demand technologies

So what do you have to lose? [Follow this link to the article](https://jacoborshalick.me/posts/nextjs-and-aws-amplify-host-a-personal-blog-in-under-30-minutes) to get started.
