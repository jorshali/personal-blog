## Want to know the easiest way to get a software team on the same page?

It’s simple.

Get in front of a whiteboard and draw a digram.

I’ve seen plenty of hour long discussions put to rest in 10 minutes with a whiteboard diagram.

When someone finally has the courage to stand up and draw out their understanding, the misunderstandings evaporate.

There may be some tweaks.

But, at least everyone can now collborate with a shared understanding.

So next time, be the one who stands up.

Draw out your understanding.

You’ll help lead your team in the right direction and get everyone on the same page.
