## What’s the toughest lesson I have to teach struggling software teams?

Stop covering up the truth!

- We just don’t have the technology expertise to do this.
- We’re not getting answers to our requriements questions.
- What we’re showing in demos is smoke and mirrors. 
- We don’t have enough time to test.
- We’re going to miss our deadline.

The truth may not be pretty, but voice your concerns.

They’re not going to magically disappear.

The time is now.

Make sure you’re heard by decision makers.

Sweeping issues under the rug will come back to bite you. 

It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when.

The longer you wait, the higher the cost.

It may even save your project.
