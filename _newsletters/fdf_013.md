## Do not shield your developers from the business

Instead, make sure your developers:

- Aren’t swamped with unnecessary meetings.
- Have ample, uninterrupted focus time.
- Aren’t constantly having to context switch.

But, don’t assume that means developers shouldn’t talk to business stakeholders.

It’s the best way for developers to gain a true understanding of the problem they’re solving.

Remember, they’re also really smart people.

They can help you come up with even better solutions if they really understand the business.

So don’t shield your developers from the business.

Let them have meaningful conversations with the stakeholders.

They’ll be more productive and you’ll get a better product.
